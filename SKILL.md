# Waterfront Reclamation Strategy

Develop comprehensive strategy for transforming industrial, underutilized, or privatized waterfronts into public amenities. Based on Amanda Burden's transformation of NYC's 520 miles of shoreline through Vision 2020, the Brooklyn waterfront, and decades of reclamation work.

---

## Constitutional Constraints

- **Public access is non-negotiable** - Every inch of waterfront belongs to the public
- **Continuous esplanade required** - No gaps in public access along the water's edge
- **Long-term thinking** - Decisions last for generations; don't compromise for short-term deals
- **Quality over speed** - A great waterfront is worth waiting for

---

## When to Use

- Industrial waterfront becoming available for redevelopment
- City seeking to reconnect residents with water's edge
- Development pressure threatening to privatize waterfront access
- Comprehensive waterfront planning initiative
- Individual waterfront sites within larger reclamation effort

## Don't Use When

- Inland sites without waterfront connection
- Waterfront is already successfully public and programmed
- Regulatory/political context doesn't allow public access requirements
- Site is too small for meaningful waterfront strategy (use detail design instead)

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| waterfront_description | Yes | Location, length, water body, current uses, ownership patterns |
| city_context | Yes | Relationship between city and water historically and currently |
| development_pressure | Recommended | Who wants to develop, what they want, timeline |
| infrastructure | Recommended | Transit, roads, utilities serving or needed by waterfront |
| community_needs | Optional | What residents lack; what they want from waterfront |
| comparable_waterfronts | Optional | Successful waterfronts in similar contexts |

## The Vision 2020 Framework

NYC's comprehensive waterfront plan provides the strategic framework:

### Eight Goals for Waterfront Transformation

1. **Expand public access** - Continuous esplanades, view corridors, points of entry
2. **Enliven the waterfront** - Programming, activity, reasons to be there
3. **Support the working waterfront** - Maritime uses have value; preserve where appropriate
4. **Improve water quality** - Clean water makes waterfronts valuable
5. **Restore the natural waterfront** - Ecology, habitat, natural shorelines
6. **Enhance the Blue Network** - The water itself is public space; kayaks, ferries, swimming
7. **Improve government oversight** - Unified waterfront management
8. **Increase climate resilience** - Sea level rise, storm surge, flooding

---

## Analysis Process

### Step 1: Waterfront Inventory

Map the entire waterfront area:

| Segment | Length | Current Use | Ownership | Access Status | Condition | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|-------|
| [Name] | [ft/mi] | [Industrial/Residential/Park/etc.] | [Public/Private] | [Open/Blocked/Limited] | [Active/Vacant/Derelict] | [Key issues] |

**Key Questions:**
- Where are the gaps in public access?
- What sites are most likely to transform (vacant, derelict, sale pending)?
- Where are the best views being blocked?
- What's the longest continuous public stretch currently?

### Step 2: Opportunity Assessment

For each segment with transformation potential:

| Opportunity Factor | Assessment | Notes |
|-------------------|------------|-------|
| **View quality** | [Exceptional/Good/Limited] | [What can you see?] |
| **Connectivity** | [Connected/Isolated] | [Transit, street grid access] |
| **Site size** | [Park-scale/Esplanade/Point access] | [Acres or linear feet] |
| **Catalytic potential** | [High/Medium/Low] | [Would it unlock other sites?] |
| **Ownership complexity** | [Simple/Moderate/Complex] | [Single owner vs. multiple] |
| **Environmental issues** | [Clean/Remediation needed] | [Brownfield status] |
| **Community support** | [Strong/Moderate/Opposed] | [Local advocacy exists?] |

### Step 3: Public Access Requirements

Design minimum public benefit requirements:

**Continuous Esplanade:**
- Minimum width: [typically 30-40 feet for urban waterfront]
- Must be public, not "publicly accessible private"
- 24/7 access without gates or restrictions
- Connects to adjacent segments without gaps

**View Corridors:**
- Identify critical views to protect
- Maximum building heights at waterfront edge
- Setback requirements for taller buildings

**Ground-Floor Activation:**
- No blank walls facing water
- Required active uses: retail, restaurants, cultural
- Outdoor seating and programming space

**Public Access Points:**
- Minimum number of entry points per linear feet
- ADA accessibility requirements
- Connections to street grid and transit

### Step 4: Development Framework

Structure the public-private deal:

**What Developers Want:**
- Waterfront premium (higher rents/prices)
- Increased density (FAR bonuses)
- Reduced parking requirements
- Streamlined approvals

**What Public Must Get:**
- Continuous waterfront esplanade
- View corridor protection
- Ground-floor activation
- Public space dedication
- Infrastructure contributions
- Affordable housing (where applicable)

**Deal Structure:**
| Developer Benefit | Public Requirement |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| [Specific benefit] | [Specific requirement] |

### Step 5: Implementation Phasing

Sequence transformation strategically:

| Phase | Segments | Priority | Dependencies | Timeline |
|-------|----------|----------|--------------|----------|
| 1 | [Catalytic sites] | Build momentum | [None] | [Years 1-3] |
| 2 | [Adjacent sites] | Extend success | [Phase 1 complete] | [Years 3-5] |
| 3 | [Difficult sites] | Complete connection | [Phase 2 shows value] | [Years 5-10] |

**Phasing Principles:**
- Start where you can win quickly to build political capital
- Prioritize catalytic sites that unlock adjacent transformation
- Save most contentious sites for when momentum is established
- Never compromise on continuous access - even if it means waiting

### Step 6: Governance and Stewardship

Plan for long-term success:

| Element | Current | Proposed | Rationale |
|---------|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Management entity** | [Who manages now?] | [Recommended structure] | [Why this works] |
| **Funding mechanism** | [Current funding] | [Sustainable model] | [How it's funded] |
| **Maintenance standards** | [Current level] | [Required standards] | [Quality requirements] |
| **Programming** | [Current activities] | [Activation plan] | [How to enliven] |

## Example

**Input:** "Our city has 3 miles of industrial riverfront that's becoming vacant as factories close. Developers are buying parcels. How do we reclaim this for the public?"

**Output:**

## Waterfront Reclamation Strategy: [River City] Industrial Waterfront

### Summary

**Opportunity:** Transform 3 miles of declining industrial riverfront into continuous public esplanade with parks, housing, and community amenities
**Scale:** 15,840 linear feet of waterfront; potential for 50+ acres of parkland
**Timeline:** 10-15 year transformation, with first public spaces in 3 years
**Priority Actions:** (1) Pass waterfront overlay zoning NOW before more sales close; (2) Acquire key connector parcels; (3) Partner with first developer willing to build demonstration project

### Context

**Historical Relationship:**
For a century, this city turned its back on its river. Factories lined the water's edge, blocking access. Residents grew up unable to touch the water that defines their city. The industrial economy that justified this barrier is gone, but the wall remains.

**Current Condition:**
Approximately 60% of riverfront is vacant or underutilized former industrial land. Ownership fragmented across 40+ parcels. No continuous public access exists. Several parcels are contaminated brownfields requiring remediation. Views of river are blocked by remaining structures.

**Development Pressure:**
Private developers have acquired or optioned roughly 30% of vacant parcels in last 18 months. Without public requirements, they will build luxury residential with "publicly accessible" private space - in practice, gated and unwelcoming. Window for public action is 12-24 months before most parcels are locked into private development.

### Waterfront Inventory

| Segment | Length | Current Use | Ownership | Access Status | Condition |
|---------|--------|-------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| North Industrial | 5,200 ft | Vacant factory | Private (3 owners) | Blocked | Derelict, brownfield |
| Central | 4,000 ft | Operating warehouse | Private (1 owner) | Blocked | Active |
| Mixed Use South | 3,500 ft | Partially developed | Private (multiple) | Limited | Varying |
| City Marina | 1,500 ft | Municipal marina | Public | Open | Good |
| South Point | 1,640 ft | Vacant | Private (developer owned) | Blocked | Cleared |

### Vision for Transformation

**The Continuous Esplanade:**
A 3-mile riverfront esplanade connecting all neighborhoods to the water. Minimum 40-foot width, including 15-foot pedestrian zone, 12-foot bike/multi-use path, and 13-foot programming/seating zone. Continuous without gaps - no segment may be blocked by private development.

**Key Destinations:**
- North Point Park (5 acres) - Remediated brownfield becomes signature park
- Central Plaza - Public space at heart of new mixed-use district
- Marina Hub - Expanded marina with kayak launch, ferry dock, waterfront dining
- South Point Sunset Park (8 acres) - Large park with event lawn, playground, water access

**Connections to City:**
- Extend 4th Street to river as primary pedestrian connection
- New transit stop (bus/eventual rail) at Central Plaza
- Green street connections every 500 feet through development

### Public Access Requirements

**Non-Negotiables:**
- 40-foot minimum public esplanade along entire waterfront
- Public ownership of esplanade, not easements
- 24/7 access without gates, guards, or restrictions
- View corridors at each cross-street (minimum 60-foot width)
- No blank walls within 200 feet of waterfront

**Required Developer Contributions:**
- Esplanade construction and 5-year maintenance fund
- Water's edge treatment (bulkhead, railings, lighting)
- Contribution to connector parks ($X per residential unit)
- Ground-floor activation with minimum 50% retail/restaurant

### Development Framework

**Density in Exchange for Quality:**

| Developer Gets | Public Gets |
|----------------|-------------|
| Waterfront premium location | Continuous public esplanade (40-foot min) |
| FAR bonus (3.0 vs 2.0 as-of-right) | View corridor preservation |
| Reduced parking (0.5 vs 1.0/unit) | Ground-floor activation |
| Streamlined approvals via overlay | Parkland dedication or fee-in-lieu |
| | Affordable housing (15% minimum) |

**Zoning Recommendations:**
- Create Waterfront Overlay District covering all parcels within 500 feet of river
- Mandatory esplanade dedication for any development
- Height limits (60 feet at waterfront, stepping up to 120 feet at inland edge)
- Active use requirements for ground floors facing water
- Transparency requirements (60% minimum glazing at ground floor)

### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Catalytic Projects (Years 1-3)**
- Pass Waterfront Overlay Zoning (Year 1) - Must happen before more private deals close
- Acquire South Point parcel for public park (Year 1-2) - City has right of first refusal
- Partner with first developer on North Point site (Year 2-3) - Demonstration of public benefit model
- Open first esplanade segment (Year 3) - Show residents what's possible

**Phase 2: Extension (Years 3-5)**
- Complete North Point Park
- Approve 3-4 additional development sites under overlay requirements
- Connect esplanade segments through new development
- Program waterfront with markets, events, performances

**Phase 3: Completion (Years 5-10)**
- Address holdout parcels (use eminent domain if necessary)
- Complete continuous esplanade (no gaps)
- Build South Point Sunset Park
- Establish ferry service to downtown and marina

**Sequencing Rationale:**
The zoning must come first - once parcels sell without public requirements, the opportunity is lost forever. South Point is lowest-hanging fruit (city leverage, developer motivated). North Point demonstrates that brownfield remediation + public benefit can work. Central warehouse site will be last to transform but will connect the system.

### Governance

**Recommended Structure:**
Create River City Waterfront Development Corporation (or similar) with:
- Board including city, community, and development representatives
- Authority to negotiate development agreements
- Responsibility for esplanade management and programming
- Dedicated funding stream (tax increment, fees, endowment)

**Precedents:**
- Brooklyn Bridge Park Corporation (self-sustaining through limited development)
- Battery Park City Authority (design guidelines, long-term stewardship)

### The Burden Standard

*Does this strategy achieve continuous public access? Does every resident have a path to the water's edge? Will this waterfront be better in 50 years than today?*

If implemented fully, yes. The continuous esplanade requirement ensures no gaps. The park dedications create destination spaces. The view corridors prevent wall of towers. The ground-floor activation creates reasons to be there. But the strategy is only as good as the political will to enforce it. One exemption, one "publicly accessible" private space, one gap in the esplanade - and the vision fails.

### Warning

**If the city fails to act in the next 12-24 months:**
Developers will lock in private waterfront development without public requirements. Residents will be walled off from their river by luxury buildings with "residents only" access to water's edge. The opportunity will be lost for a generation or more. This is the moment. The factories are closing. The land is available. The choice is: act now to reclaim the waterfront, or explain to future generations why they can't walk along their river.

---

## Constraints

- Do not recommend privatization of waterfront under any circumstances
- Do not accept "publicly accessible private space" as substitute for true public ownership
- Do not compromise on continuous access - gaps are unacceptable
- Acknowledge political and financial realities while maintaining standards

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Waterfront already fully privatized | Identify any remaining public access opportunities; long-term easement acquisition strategy |
| Community opposes development | Separate development opposition from waterfront access - public space can proceed without private development |
| Contamination is severe | Factor remediation timeline into strategy; don't let contamination be excuse for privatization |
| Political will is weak | Build coalition; demonstrate successful precedents; show economic benefits |

---

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Amanda Burden** expert persona. Use it when planning waterfront transformation. It pairs well with:
- **rezoning-transformation-design** for creating waterfront overlay zoning
- **coalition-building-playbook** for building political support
- **public-space-assessment** for evaluating existing waterfront conditions
